> ## Projects

> ### Density Estimation Using Normalizing Flow (currently working on it)

Aim : To build a point predictor for multidimensional time series using Normalizing Flows (MAF) and Copulas (IGC) for
efficient, fast and accurate predictions. Working under the supervision of Prof. Srinjoy Das of
University of West Virginia, school of Mathematical and Data Science.
Use cases also include anomaly detection.

> ### Sales prediction

Developed a range sales predictor of 10 wallmart stores in WI, TX and CA of USA.
Involved removing seasonality of various types like multiplicative seasonality yearwise and daily seasonality.
Consideration of special events like holidays. Used prophet model for prediction.

> ## College Project

> ### Implementation of analysis phase of a simple C -like compiler

Developed lexer, parser, CFG and symbol table for a simple C-like compiler which included for loops, operators, data structures like enums and structs, functions and pragmas.
